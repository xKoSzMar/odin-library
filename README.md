# The Odin Project 8 - odin-library

This is the eighth project from The Odin Project curriculum.

It is an library app where book cards can be added. Every card contains:

- title
- author
- pages
- whether it has been read or not

The UI is made of book cards and add button. When the add button is clicked, form shows up where all needed information can be entered. The form has validation which does not allow to add the card without filling all inputs.

Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
